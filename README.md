# About-Me
I found parseInt() online. I kept getting a NaN when it was assigned. I searched onlined to look for other options and learned in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1133770/convert-a-string-to-an-integer-in-javascript/20513389#20513389 that it is very important to specify the radix (second input to the parseInt() function). 

Nicholas (once) and Ed (2-3 times) provided coaching.

I used a flow chart to help me dissect this problem. It allowed me to focus my efforts rather than spending time on unnecessary features.
